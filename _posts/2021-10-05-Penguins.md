# Palmer Penguins Data Visualization Tutorial

Data Visualization is a quite useful tool in Python. In this post, Iâ€™ll show how to create a histogram visualizing Palmer Penguins Data.

When we want to plot a histogram of culmen length on penguin species, we need the culmen length grouped by the species first. We will first prepare the data for plotting, and then make a plot. Let's go step by step!

Let us begin by importing *Palmer Penguins* dataset with the code below. 


```python
import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```

Nice! Here we got a dataframe `penguins`. You could take a look at the dataframe by running the code below.


```python
penguins
```

## 1. Data Preparation
First we want to sort out the `Species` column to make the species names of the penguins more readable. We do this by chopping up the species names at the first word.

Hint: We use the command `.str.split()` to split the species names by space, and the command `.str.get()` to determine the number of words we remain.


```python
penguins["Species"] = penguins["Species"].str.split().str.get(0)
```

## 2. Make a plot

Run the code below to import the necessary libraries for plotting.


```python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

We want to plot a histogram to explore the culmen length varied among different penguin species. So, we need to differentiate the penguin species and access the culmen lengths of the penguins respectively. The basic logic will be:

* Iterate over three species names `Gentoo`, `Adelie`, `Chinstrap`
* Access the culmen lengths in species by extracting the column `Culmen Length (mm)`.
* Plot the number of penguins with a certain culmen length in the histogram, and label different species with different colors.
* Set axis labels, title, and legend to make the histogram more readable.

Create a list including the species name `Gentoo`, `Adelie`, `Chinstrap` for iteration.


```python
species = ["Gentoo", "Adelie", "Chinstrap"] 
```

Iterate over the species name list, and extracr the `Culmen Length (mm)` column from the dataframe for each species. Eliminate the rows with the NaN values with the command `.notnull()`. 

The histogram will indicate the density of a certain culmen length in a certain species. Use different colors to label `Gentoo`, `Adelie`, and `Chinstrap`.

Set the x-axis label, y-axis label, and the title of the histogram to make it more understandable.
Include the legend with the command `ax.legend()`.


```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1)

for name in species:
    length = penguins[penguins["Species"] == name]["Culmen Length (mm)"] 
    # drop the NaN values
    length = length[length.notnull()] 
    # set the bar transparency with alpha value
    ax.hist(length, label = name, alpha = 0.4) 
    
ax.set(xlabel = "Culmen Length (mm)", 
        ylabel = "Density", 
        title = "Culmen Length on Species") 
ax.legend()
```

We could see that the culmen lengths on species are shown and labeled with different colors.
